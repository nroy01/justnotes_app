# Privacy Policy for JustNotes
**Last updated:** August 2025

JustNotes is designed to work **offline**. We **do not collect** personal data, and we **do not track** users.

## Information We Collect
We **do not collect, transmit, or store** any personal data on our servers.  
All notes, drawings, PDFs, and settings are stored **locally on your device**.

## Third-Party Services
JustNotes uses only Apple system frameworks (e.g., PencilKit, UIKit).  
We do **not** integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

## Network Access
The app does not require network access for core functionality. If you choose to share or export files via the iOS share sheet, those actions are user-initiated.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
JustNotes does not collect data from anyone, including children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us outside the app (e.g., via email), contact us and we will delete it.

## Data Security
Your content remains on your device unless you explicitly export or share it.

## Changes to This Policy
If we make material changes, we will update this page and the date above.
